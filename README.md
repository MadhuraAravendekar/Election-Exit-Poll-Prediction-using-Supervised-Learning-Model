##Business Problem Statement:-

You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. 
This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, 
to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

##Steps which was followed before traning Machine Learning Algorithms: 
1. Uploading the data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
4. Modelling scaling
5. Train Test split
6. Building various supervise learning algorithm:
     a.Logistict Regression and Linear discriminate Analysis
     b. K Nearest Neighbour Alogrithm and Naive Bayes Model.
     c. Ensemble Technique: Bagging and Gradient Boosting
7. Plotted Performance Metrics across every model.
8. Drawn the conclusion
